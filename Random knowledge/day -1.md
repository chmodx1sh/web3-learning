## Ethereum
Ethereum is like platform, on which thousands of computers(nodes) are running. Ether and eth is currency same as bitcoin (BTC). Connection between ethereum and ether/eth is etherem nodes need to be invencites by eth currency.
Ethereum is decentralised, open source, blockchain system that feautres it's own crypto currency.
De - centralized -> power is not in hand of single person, it is distributed, it's like if i want to create a decentralized app then i need to know how decentralization works, a language that works on blockchain(solidity), and i need network of computers, that will be provided by this platform ethereum, and on ethereum there will be EVM (Ethereum virtual machine) on that my code will be executed.

## Smart Contract
Smart contracts are simply programs that will be written in solidity languagae stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. Anyone can write a smart contract and deploy it to the network. You just need to learn how to code in a smart contract language, and have enough ETH to deploy your contract.

## EVM 
blockchain based software, i will deploy my code over it.

## Yul
yul is like compiler in web2, Yul is a programming language that is being used as an intermediate language in the compilation of Ethereum smart contracts written in in the Solidity language.
